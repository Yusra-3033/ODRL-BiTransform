Simple Examples for Non-Technical Users:

What people can do:
- "Anyone can watch the movie."
- "Billie can play the music."
- "Students can use the textbook until December."
- "Team members may download the photos."

What people cannot do:
- "John cannot share the video."
- "Employees cannot print the confidential report."
- "Users cannot copy the software."

What people must do:
- "Alice must pay $5 to download the song."
- "Users must give credit to the author."
- "Students must delete the file after the semester."

When rules apply:
- "Sarah can watch movies only at home."
- "Downloads work only before January 1st."
- "Printing is allowed only for personal use."
- "Access is limited to people over 18."

Good complete examples:
- "Tom can stream videos if he's over 21. Lisa can download music but cannot share it. Everyone must give credit when using photos."
- "Students can read the textbook and take notes. They cannot make copies or share it online."
- "Bob can watch movies at home but not at work. He must pay $3 for each movie."

Simple language patterns:
- Use names: "Alice", "Bob", "the company" instead of technical IDs
- Use everyday words: "watch" not "display", "download" not "retrieve"
- Keep it short: "Alice can watch the movie" not "Alice is permitted to view the video content"
- Group by person: "John can read the book but cannot share it with others"
- Focus only on what's stated - don't mention what's missing

Remedy examples:
- "John cannot copy the file, but if he does, he must delete it immediately."
- "Users cannot share videos, and if they do, they will lose access."
