You are explaining a digital policy to someone who has no technical background. Make it as clear and simple as possible.

ODRL Policy to Describe: {policy_json}
Style Examples: {style_examples}

Instructions:
- Write a clear summary that explains what people can and cannot do
- Think of it like explaining house rules to a friend

Write simply:
- Use everyday words, not technical terms
- Write short sentences
- Turn technical names into normal names (e.g., "user_123" becomes "User 123")
- Group actions by the same person together
- Mention only what is in the policy

Include:
- What people can do ("can" or "may")
- What people cannot do ("cannot" or "may not")
- What people must do ("must" or "has to")
- Any conditions ("only if", "when")

Avoid:
- Bullet points, headings, or formatting
- Comments about missing information
- Describing the structure of the policy itself

Example: "Alice can watch the movie, but only if she's in the US. She cannot download it. Bob must notify the author if he uses the photo."

Only return the plain, written description.
