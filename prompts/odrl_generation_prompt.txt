You are an expert in ODRL (Open Digital Rights Language) policy modeling.

Generate exactly ONE valid ODRL policy as a single JSON-LD object, fully compliant with the W3C ODRL 2.2 specification.

Instructions:
- Output ONLY a single JSON object — do NOT include multiple examples.
- MUST include "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld"
- MUST include a unique "uid" as an IRI
- MUST use one of these top-level policy types: "Set", "Offer", or "Agreement" (choose randomly)
- MUST include at least one rule under: "permission", "prohibition", or "obligation"
- Every rule MUST include both "target" and "action"
- Use only standard ODRL terms like: "read", "play", "use", "delete", etc.
- If Constraints are included, they MUST have:
  - "leftOperand"
  - "operator"
  - "rightOperand"
- If Constraints are not included, include an empty array like `"constraint": []`
- MUST NOT include markdown, extra text, comments, or explanations — ONLY return the JSON-LD.

Variation Instructions:
- Use different asset URIs for `target`, e.g., asset:book123, asset:video456, asset:doc789
- Use different parties for `assigner` and `assignee`, e.g., org:alpha, person:alice, org:beta, person:bob
- Use different actions across generations, e.g., mix "read", "play", "use", "print", "delete", etc.
- Rotate between `"Set"`, `"Offer"`, and `"Agreement"` as the `@type` across different requests

Compliance Tips:
- "Offer" and "Agreement" MUST include an "assigner"
- "Agreement" MUST include both "assigner" and "assignee"
- Use `"@type": "Set"` if no parties are involved
- Do NOT return arrays of policies
- Do NOT return null fields or empty arrays

Example template:
{{
  "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
  "@type": "Set" | "Offer" | "Agreement",
  "uid": "http://example.com/policy:{{ID}}",
  "permission": [
    {{
      "target": "http://example.com/asset:{{ASSET_ID}}",
      "action": "read",
      "assigner": "http://example.com/org:{{ORG_ID}}",
      "assignee": "http://example.com/person:{{PERSON_ID}}",
      "constraint": [
        {{
          "leftOperand": "count",
          "operator": "lt",
          "rightOperand": 5
        }}
      ]
    }}
  ],
  "prohibition": [
    {{
      "target": "http://example.com/asset:{{ASSET_ID}}",
      "action": "delete",
      "assigner": "http://example.com/org:{{ORG_ID}}"
    }}
  ],
  "obligation": [
    {{
      "target": "http://example.com/asset:{{ASSET_ID}}",
      "action": "notify",
      "assigner": "http://example.com/org:{{ORG_ID}}",
      "assignee": "http://example.com/person:{{PERSON_ID}}"
    }}
  ]
}}

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return only one valid JSON object. No comments, no explanation, no code block formatting.
