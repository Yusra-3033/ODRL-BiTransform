# Prompt Template for Generating ODRL Policies 
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

You are an expert in semantic policy modeling and digital rights languages. Generate diverse and well-structured ODRL policies using the ODRL context and W3C vocabulary.

ODRL Context URI:
{context_uri}

Ontology Definitions:
{ontology}

W3C Modeling Recommendations:
{recommendations}

Example Policies:
{seed_examples}

{complexity}

---

Instructions:
- Generate {num} NEW ODRL policies in valid JSON-LD.
- Each policy MUST include the following top-level fields:
  - "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld"
  - "@type": one of Set, Offer, Agreement, or Policy
  - "uid": a unique IRI

- Every policy MUST include at least one of these: "permission", "prohibition", or "obligation".
- Each permission/prohibition/obligation rule MUST contain:
  - "@type": "Permission", "Prohibition", or "Duty"
  - "target": a valid IRI
  - "action": a valid ODRL action term
  - Optional: "assigner", "assignee", and "constraint"

- If constraints are included, each constraint MUST contain:
  - "leftOperand"
  - "operator"
  - "rightOperand"

- Use ONLY valid ODRL terms from the provided vocabulary. Do NOT invent terms.

- Avoid logically invalid or structurally incomplete policies:
  - Do NOT leave out required fields
  - Do NOT use both "greaterThan 5" AND "lessThan 3" on the same operand
  - Do NOT use "eq 'X'" AND "isNoneOf ['X']" on the same operand

- Ensure the policy conforms to SHACL structure and semantic rules.

- Vary the following across policies:
  - actions (e.g., read, write, use, copy, delete)
  - constraint types (e.g., purpose, count, dateTime, systemDevice)
  - constraint operators (e.g., lt, gt, eq, isAnyOf, isNoneOf)
  - assignees and assigners
  - target asset URIs

Output ONLY the JSON-LD for each policy. No comments, no explanations, no markdown.
